<h1>Classes vs id.</h1>
<h2>What is a class and what is an id?</h2>
<h3>id and class attributes are used to style elements, 
  they are known as id and class selectors.</h3>
  <p>Class allows you to use the same css style on multiple elements, where as an 
    id attribute is not reusable and should only be applied to one element. 
    It is important to note that id attributes have more importance than a class attribute so 
    if you are applying both a class and id attribute to the same element
    the styles of the id will always be applied. </p>
    <p>id elements will always have a # in front of it when applying it in css </p>
