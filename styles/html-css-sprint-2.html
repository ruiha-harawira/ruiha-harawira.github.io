<h1>Classes vs id.</h1>
<h2>What is a class and what is an id?</h2>
<h3>id and class attributes are used to style elements, 
  they are known as id and class selectors.</h3>
  <p><b>Class</b> allows you to use the same css style on multiple elements, where as an 
    <b>id</b> attribute is unique and not reusable. It should only be applied to one element. 
    <div></div>
    It is important to note that id attributes have more importance than a class attribute so 
    if you are applying both a class and id attribute to the same element
    the styles of the id attribute will always override the class attribute. </p>
    <div></div>
    <p>id elements will always have a # in front of it when applying it in css like so</p>
  <div></div>
