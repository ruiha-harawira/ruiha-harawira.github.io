    <h1>Ruiha Harawira</h1> 
    <p> Kia ora everyone! My name is Ruiha and I grew up in a small town in the Kapiti coast. 
    </p>
    <p> Welcome to my webpage, it will eventually contain a list of links to all of my blogs and things I have learnt. It's not 
      very spectacular at the moment but hopefully my blog will grow along with myself as I embark on this new journey of learning code
      and becoming a web developer. </p>
