      <h1>My learning plan</h1>
      <p>My future goal is to have a job as a web developer hopefully doing something for Te ao Maori. 
        I would love to have that location freedom to work remotely or overseas if I wanted to as well.
      </p>
      <p>I want to work on being more organised with my time. This week was stressful for me as I started 
        mid week so I put that unnecessary pressure on myself. I will work on my time management in the future 
        by starting things at a reasonable time and using timer apps.</p>
        <p>I am going to manage my workload by taking more breaks. I am finding I get more fatigued when I don't 
          take regular breaks to give my eyes a rest, and I am much more productive after having had one. </p>
          <p>I am committed to trying to figure out the problems on my own first. I have found on a few occasions 
            I have jumped the gun, asked for help, tried to figure it out on my own whilst waiting on a response from someone. 
            And funnily enough I end up working it out on my own sometimes… I think that falls from the lack of confidence weakness 
            that I mentioned in my identity and values section. </p>
            <p> My expectations of the facillitators is that they will be available, supportive and compassionate, I 
              Will be seeking for help through Youtube, discord channels and google. I currently have no block out 
              times that will effect my learning in the future.
            </p>

        <h1>Bootcamp learning plan</h1>
        <p><b>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</b> I would really like to finish this course and hopefully get my foot in the 
        door into becoming a full stack developer. My long term career goal would be working somewhere that is for maori or even owning my own business. I 
      would like to encourage maori and pacifika that you don't need to have come from the best school or have the highest academic record. As long as you have the 
    right attitude and drive you can easily do something like this.</p>
        <p><b>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</b> I think my biggest strengths will be my ability to persevere although that 
        is also a limitation as sometimes if I am feeling very overwhelmed I can tend to feel very discouraged and that is when I start to listen to the voice in my head telling
      me that I can't do it. But it is all about the way you adapt and get back up and I think I am pretty good at not giving up even when it is hard.</p>
      <p><b>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</b> definitely speaking in a group and having to get up and speak. I tend to get 
      really nervous when It comes to public speaking that I tend to shut down and forget what I am saying and the words sounds like mumbling. also retention is going to be a 
    problem as I am already finding it hard to retain some of the information.</p>  
     <p><b>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</b>
    I think just being more outgoing, not being so shy talking to new groups of people and being more confident to voice my thoughts and opinions.</p>
    <p><b>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</b> I hope that they are patient and kind with me as I know I am definitely going to struggle throughout so having a good
    support system there that I know isn't judging me will help me to feel more comfortable to express myself.</p>
    <p><b>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</b> That I will be highly organised and manage my time accordingly, I will get enough
    rest and sleep every day. I will be respectful of others and help in any way I can. I will be open- minded and also try to stay on top of my workload</p>
