      <h1>My learning plan</h1>
      <p>My future goal is to have a job as a web developer hopefully doing something for Te ao Maori. 
        I would love to have that location freedom to work remotely or overseas if I wanted to as well.
      </p>
      <p>I want to work on being more organised with my time. This week was stressful for me as I started 
        mid week so I put that unnecessary pressure on myself. I will work on my time management in the future 
        by starting things at a reasonable time and using timer apps.</p>
        <p>I am going to manage my workload by taking more breaks. I am finding I get more fatigued when I don't 
          take regular breaks to give my eyes a rest, and I am much more productive after having had one. </p>
          <p>I am committed to trying to figure out the problems on my own first. I have found on a few occasions 
            I have jumped the gun, asked for help, tried to figure it out on my own whilst waiting on a response from someone. 
            And funnily enough I end up working it out on my own sometimes… I think that falls from the lack of confidence weakness 
            that I mentioned in my identity and values section. </p>
            <p> My expectations of the facillitators is that they will be available, supportive and compassionate, I 
              Will be seeking for help through Youtube, discord channels and google. I currently have no block out 
              times that will effect my learning in the future.
            </p>
