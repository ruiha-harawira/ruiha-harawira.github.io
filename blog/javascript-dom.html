<h1>Javascript and the DOM</h1>
<p><em>HTML is the skeleton of your body, CSS is the skin, Javascript is 
  the brain making everything move and function.</em></p>
<p>Control flow and loops:</p>
<p>Control flow is the order in which instructions in your programme are executed. 
  Loops allows you to repeat an action a number of times without having to type them 
  in again and again.</p>
<p>In a real life scenario let's say for example a baker that is icing some cookies the 
  action would be 
  <ol>
   <li> Squeeze a dot of icing onto a cookie </li>
   <li> If there are no more cookies, takes a break </li>
   <li> Goes back to step 1</li>
  </ol>
  And that is repeated until all the cookies are finished being iced.
  Loops in programming are similar you execute the same instructions until the job is done.
</p>
<p>The DOM</p>
<p>The special glue that ties HTML, CSS and java script together is the document object model 
    or the 'DOM' Everything that makes up your DOM is known as nodes 
    These nodes can be anything from:
  <ul>
    <li>elements</li>
    <li>Attributes</li>
    <li>Text content</li>
    <li>Documents</li>
   </ul> And many other things that we don't think about
</p>
<p>So how do you access html to manipulate it?
   Depending on what you are wanting to do an easy way to make things easier to grab is by giving
   them unique ID's, or putting the things you want to manipulate in the same class so that they 
   are easier to access. 
</p>
<p>We can use a few things like 
  <ul>
    <li>getElementsByTagName(p, div)</li>
    <li>getElementsByClassName</li>
    <li>getElementsbyId()</li>
    <li>getElementsbyName</li>
    <li>getElementsByTagNameNS</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>To start off say you are wanting to grab an <pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> </pre>element you would use <b>document.querySelector('h1')</b>.
   If you wanted to grab all of your paragraphs you can use another method like this <b>document.querySelectorAll('p')</b> 
   which will return an array of matching <pre><code>&lt;p&gt;</code></pre> elements otherwise <b>querySelector('p')</b> 
   will return the first paragraph 
   element on your HTML
</p>
<p>Another useful tip is changing text in HTML we can use the innerHTML method along with many other useful methods 
   to change and manipulate your HTML. The DOM is not a part of java script language, it is a form of web API. It represents the page so that we can 
   change the structure, style, and content on the page. 
</p>
<p>Objects vs arrays:</p>
<p>Objects is a container used to display data types that store a collection of data. Arrays are a special type of 
   variable used to store a list of values. We use arrays when we want to create a list of things in a single variable 
   say we want to store all of our favourite foods the array would look something like </p>
<p><pre><code>favouriteFoods = [ 'Noodles', 'burgers', 'fruit', 'sushi'];</code></pre></p>
<p>Here we are listing an array of our favourite foods in a single variable. Now lets make an object for myself it would 
   look something like this 
</p>
<div><p>
  <pre><code>
    var human = { 
      name: 'Ruiha',
      lastName: 'Harawira'
      Age: 25,
    }
</code></pre>
</p></div>
<p>Here I have stored a collection of data about myself inside an object. Another example of declaring objects could look 
   something like this we will refer to our javascript cafe tutorial </p>
<div><p>
    <pre>
    <code>
      let products = {
          whiteCoffee: {
                stock: 4,
                price: 4,
                },
          blackCoffee: {
                stock: 7,
                price: 3.5,
                },
    </code>
    </pre>
</p></div>
<p>Here we are declaring the object products which include whiteCoffee, blackCoffee and the price and stock of each of those items.</p>
<p>Functions:</p>
<p>Functions are one of fundamental building blocks in javascript. A function is a set of statements that performs a task or 
  return a value. Lets have a look at an example below, say we want the function to display a message on the console we would 
  write something like this.
</p>
<div><p>
  <pre>
  <code>
    function greet () {
      console.log('Kia Ora Dev academy');
   }
  </code>
  </pre>
</p></div>
<p>Here we are asking the function to display 'Kia Ora Dev academy' to the console. If we go back to our earlier example 
  of objects we could use functions to display our products on to the console like so</p>
<div><p>
      <pre>
      <code>
          function displayProducts() {
            document.getElementById('whiteCoffee').innerHTML =
              'White Coffee: ' + products.whiteCoffee.stock
          
            document.getElementById('blackCoffee').innerHTML =
              'Black Coffee: ' + products.blackCoffee.stock
     </code>
     </pre>
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>Here we use function to display our items and also use some methods I mentioned about the DOM by grabbing the element 
    by its ID and using .innerHTML to change the text. An analogy example of a function would be a recipe for a cake. 
    The function is the input used to declare all the ingredients and the implementation is the steps to be used to produce
    the cake.
