    <h1>Problem solving</h1>
    <p>
      <b>Tell us about a time that you felt blocked on a simple problem?</b>
      There have been a lot of times I have been stuck on problems during most of my time in 
      foundations where I have over thought the questions. This is all a new area of learning 
      for me so learning the new words and breaking things down and simplifying them have really helped! 
      A problem I encountered during the kata exercises was assigning properties and defining them as an object. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The question was <em>"The value of the terah children property should be defined as an object"
    </em> When I first read that question my mind automatically gets confused as to what my first step should be
    Straight away I over thought the question and started to write a new variable named terah which didn't seem 
    to work at all because the object terah had already been declared earlier in the exercise. This is where my 
    overthinking gets the better of me. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The solution was to just use <pre><code>terah.children: {}</code></pre> and then insert the children
  between the {} It was an ah ha! Moment for me where I realised not to over analyse questions too much as the 
  answer they are wanting could be something completely simple! 
</p>
<p>
  Some of the things that have helped me to problem solve include
<ul>
<li>Pseudocode</li>
<li>Trying something/Trouble shooting</li>
<li>Reading error messages</li>
<li>console.logging</li>
<li>Googling/Youtube</li>
<li>Asking my peers/Facilitators for help</li>
<li>Doing some self reflections</li>
</ul>
