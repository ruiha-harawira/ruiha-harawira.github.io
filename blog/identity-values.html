     <h1> Identity, values and ethics</h1>   
     <p>When I think of my values I think of respect, compassion, loyalty and whanau. I hold a lot of gratitude towards 
       my upbringing as the saying goes “It takes a village to raise a child” and I really did have a village of strong-minded, 
       driven and loving Whānau members supporting me and helping my mother to raise me. Growing up my Koro was my father 
       figure in my life, a man of many talents. An ex SAS and vietnam war veteran, a teacher, a curator for museums along with
        many other things. From a young age he instilled the saying that “knowledge is power” always encouraging me to read books 
        and continuously up skill wherever I can.</p>
        <p>Along with my Koro there was also my mother. She is such a selfless and generous person. I watched her work her butt 
          off when I was younger to provide for us and save up enough money to get our first home. My mother is one of the strongest
          woman I know, a true mana wahine in my eyes and one of my biggest role models. She has taught me a lot about hard work and 
          resilience but also how to be kind and caring. 
        </p>
        <p>I also think my culture is a huge part of my identity I pride myself on being Maori and I know that I can be successful in 
          the modern world but also pupuri ki aku tikanga (hold on to our cultural customs and practices), and be humble. </p>
          <p>I think one of my biggest strengths is resilience and being able to get back up after feeling defeated. Something that I
             will be working on during my time at dev academy will be my self confidence. I tend to feel stressed when I feel something 
             is not up to the standard I would like it to be. I also want to get out of the habit of comparing my work to my class mates. 
             I just need to believe in myself more. 
         </p>
         <p><em>“one value of yours I have always appreciated is that you have really good perspective. You have the ability to see both sides 
           of the story without holding any judgement and that's really valuable in a friendship in my opinion. This also allows you to be 
           really open minded, considerate and empathic, all of which are very inspiring characteristics. You communicate well and aren't 
           afraid to share your opinion when necessary, which tells me you are strong minded and confident. I also believe having such a loyal 
           and loving bond with your family are testament to the way that you are. You have a lot of strong woman around you who are very inspiring 
           in their own way and I believe you follow in their footsteps naturally. Having Māori heritage is also an important factor in the way 
           that you've been brought up based on your ethical values and the way you look at life. I'm very blessed to have someone like you in my life 
           who is supportive and loving the way that you are. I don't know if I could be critical of anything that you do to be honest. Maybe have more 
           faith in yourself and what you're capable of achieving because you have a lot of beautiful qualities”
          - Amokura Rangiheuea, a childhood best friend </em>
