<h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>
<p><b>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.
</b> Understanding neuroplasticity is very beneficial as it gives people the knowledge 
that your brain is elastic it can grow, adapt and change and it is a way to condition 
your brain to have better experiences. Every time you learn something new you are 
harnessing the power of neuroplasticity. </p>
<p><b>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.</b>
  To enhance neuroplasticity in my life I will be practicing the principle of repetition. 
  To help generate changes in my brain I need to keep practicing and working on something 
  so that It becomes like second nature to me, and I can constantly improve on something 
  if I know I am comfortable with what I am doing</p>
<p><b>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?
</b>Some of the ways to increase neuroplasticity are by doing repetition or following 
the use it or lose it method which in other words means if you stop performing a task or learning 
something for a long period of time the circuits in your brain will eventually forget how 
to do it or be a bit rusty because it hasn't been required for that specific task. 
And this is why it is so important to continuously practice things or you will eventually 
forget how to do it. </p>

<h2>Growth mindset</h2>
<p><b>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</b> 
  A growth mindset is having the ability to be open minded to learn and acknowledge that you 
  are capable of doing things. The only thing stopping you, is yourself. If you continuously 
  live in a fixed mindset and tell yourself "I'm not good at math or I'm not good at running" 
  you are essentially telling your brain these things and it will start to believe it. But 
  if you have a growth mindset and tell yourself I might not be good at this but I can teach 
  myself or I am willing to learn you will always be in the mindset of growing and being the 
  best version of yourself which in turn can actually be extremely beneficial for your mental
   health and your growth in every aspect of your life.
</p>
<p><b>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</b>
No, I actually used to read alot of books to do with personal growth and mindset</p>
<p><b>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</b>
  I already integrate it to a certain degree, I am very open minded when it comes to up-skilling 
  and I tend to not let the voice in my head telling me I can't do something effect me too much. 
  I go into things with an open mind and the understanding that this is something completely new to me. 
  A few years ago my friends dad told me  “if it doesn't scare you, make you feel uncomfortable or confused
   then you are not growing“ and that is something that has stuck with me ever since. 
</p>
<p>I didn't use any external links for this but a book I could recommend is reading Atomic habits 
  by James clear it really changed my life and talks about how your beliefs can sabotage your
   behaviour, How to set better habits and get out of bad ones in order to grow. </p>
