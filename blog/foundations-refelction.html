  <h1>My reflections from foundations</h1>
  <p><b>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your 
    ego due to the core learning?</b>
  <ul>
    <li>To be more patient with myself and that I am not always going to understand everything
      straight away. 
    </li>
    <li>I learnt alot about my own ego and how uncomfortable it can be, being in a new environment and not comparing
      myself to others that have alot more experience than I do.
    </li>
    <li>I learnt about new learning techniques such as the principles of neuroplasticity and one of them being repition that has 
      helped me alot with learning html and css having to make blog posts often.
    </li>
  </ul></p>
  <p><b>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</b>
  I am not too sure of this question but I would say it relates to not being too hard on yourself, realising that values, empathy and 
self awareness is what shapes you as a person. Even though you may be amazing at something you may not be at another and to remind yourself 
that you may take a little longer than others but as long as you are self aware and percevere you are alot more capable than you think.
</p>
<p><b>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</b> I think just deep diving into myself and learning about my soft skills, it's not 
often you are asked to sit down and think about your identity and your values. I found it quite confronting but also very eye opening in a good way as 
I know the core learning I have learnt in foundations will be something I will carry on for the rest of my life.</p>
<p><b>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</b> I think asking tough questions was a hard part and also doing the pairing and looping
I am quite a shy person but talking to others made me realise we are all in the same boat we just have to climb that first hurdle.</p>
<p><b>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</b>
Because they want someone that can work in a team and also show empathy to others. They're not looking for someone that is amazing at tech as that stuff 
can be taught. Soft skills is something you need to develop over time and to me is more important than having excellent knowledge about tech</p>
<p><b>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
</b> Absolutely not! I have really enjoyed doing the core part of the learning, it has actually been my favorite part. Core learning has helped me to understand diffeerent ways 
of problem solving and also just given me the time to reflect on what I can do differently. </p>
