<h1>Classes vs id</h1>
<h2>What is a class and what is an id?</h2>
<h3>id and class attributes are used to style elements, 
  they are known as id and class selectors</h3>
  <p><b>Class</b> allows you to use the same style on multiple elements, where as an 
    <b>id</b> attribute is unique and not reusable it should only be applied to one element. 
    It is important to note that id attributes have more importance than a class attribute so 
    if you are applying both a class and id attribute to the same element
    the styles of the id will always override the class attribute. </p>
<p>Examples of using id and class attributes into css and HTML:</p>
    <p>id elements will always have a # in front of it when applying it in css</p>
  <pre>
    <code>
      "#example-of-id {
           background-color: yellow;
         }"
        </code>
  </pre> 
  <p>if you want to put an id element into html it will look like this</p>
<pre>
  <code>
&lt;h2 id="example-of-id"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  </code>
</pre>
<p>Both print yellow text</p>
<p>Applying a class attribute into CSS looks like this</p>
<pre>
  <code>
&lt;style&gt; .blue-text { color: blue; }&lt;/style&gt;
  </code>
</pre>
<p>And finally what a class attribute would look like in HTML</p>
<pre>
  <code>
&lt;h2 class= "blue-text"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  </code>
</pre>
<p>Both would print blue text</p>
