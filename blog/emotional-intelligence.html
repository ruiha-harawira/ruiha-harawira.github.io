<h1>EQ and IQ</h1>
<p><em>IQ tests measure your ability to solve problems, use logic, and grasp 
  or communicate complex ideas. EQ tests measure your ability to recognise 
  emotion in yourself and others, and to use that awareness to guide your 
  decisions
</em></p>
<p>Emotional intelligence to me is understanding and being self aware of your 
  feelings and how to control the emotions of yourself and others around you. 
  I believe having a higher EQ allows you to understand others, show initiative 
  and gives you the ability to work well in a team and show compassion. </p>
  <p>Having a high IQ is equally as important as EQ as it gives you the ability to 
    think logically. They both compliment eachother however if you are lacking in 
    emotional intelligence I think you will find it hard to relate to others and build 
    stable relationships. </p>
